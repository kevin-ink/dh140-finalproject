# Final Project Brainstorming

## Data and Vis of Interest
### [Sentiment Analysis of Airline Passengers' Tweets](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03611981231172948?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.9)

I chose this article because I am interested in doing humanities computing on topics relating to air travel, airplanes, and airports. Since airports are big hubs where diverse groups of people interact, they can lead to really interesting research topics.

### A 3D Visualization made using Python

I really like this visualization since it has a 3rd dimension to it which can be engaging to the viewer. However, the image provided is just an image but I would like my visualization to be interactive in the 3D plane.

## Ideas for Data to Investigate
* Impact of Social Media on Airplane Etiquette
1. [Briefing Airlines and Social Media](https://www.wfw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WFW-Briefing-Airlines-and-Social-Media-February-2019.pdf)
2. [Role of Social Media in an Aviation Crisis](https://www.airport-technology.com/features/role-of-social-media-in-an-aviation-crisis/)
* Impact of Airports on Surrounding Commmunities
1. [How Airports Are Helping Communities](https://www.stantec.com/en/ideas/topic/buildings/beyond-the-terminals-how-airports-are-helping-strengthen-communities-and-promote-culture)
2. [Measuring Quality of Life near Airports](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25918/chapter/2)

## Ideas from Curated Datasets and Project Lists
Name|Description|Link
:---|:---|:---
Air Quality|Responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Coding will help to disect and analyze the data using computation.|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality
COVID Data Segmented by Geolocation|Vast COVID data that can be filtered by geolocation. Using computation, we can figure out if certain areas have more COVID signals than others and which areas have the most COVID signals.|https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/
